<br />
FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization created by Quincy Larson that is made up of a learning web platform, forum and blog that intends to teach web development to anyone.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Web Platform
<br />
It is a learning web platform that teaches through the tasks that the students have to complete and still it trains them for interviews. If the person has any doubts, he is encouraged to search and to ask to other developers. Thus, It can simulate the professional progression of a developer.
<br />
Currently, It offers six certificates: Responsive Web Design, Algorithms And Data Structures, Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, Apis And Microservices and Information Security And Quality Assurance.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Front-End and Back-End
<br />
Basically, web development is taught in two parts, Front End and Back End.
<br />
Front End is introduced with the languages HTML, CSS. It is also presented in frameworks and libraries like BootStrap, JQuery and React.
<br />
The Back End section offers the concept of the version control with Git and Heroku cloud platform as a service (PaaS) for running applications. The students also train with NodeJS framework and MongoDB database program. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Projects
<br />
They also offer  hints of projects to develop and build and this way creates a portfolio. Firstly, it shows a project already done for the developer to base. Lastly, it lists several user stories for the developer to fulfill. The projects require the knowledge of the Front End/Back End frameworks to create a client-server interaction.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Conclusion
<br />
The platform allows me to know new technologies and patterns through interactive ways, to get in touch with the community and to build applications. I recommend the FreeCodeCamp to anyone that wants to program or to start in web development.
