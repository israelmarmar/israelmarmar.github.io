## Introduction
<br />
Working in an IT job in a foreign country has always been my ambition. I was a computer engineer student and already know how to program. I searched for any jobs in my field through Linkedin. But the jobs I found required knowledge in certain web patterns and languages. To meet the requirements, I searched online platforms to learn programming languages and web frameworks.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Online interactive platforms
<br />
CodeAcademy is an online interactive platform that offers several languages and frameworks that I can learn and program. FreeCodeCamp is another that I found to learn new languages and front-end/back-end patterns for web development and to create projects.

## Blogs and sites
<br />
There are many things around web programming that I did not know, thus I have begun to read several sites and blogs about front-end and back-end. I have gotten into the web development. I learned about new frameworks and patterns for front-end and back-end.

## Conclusion
<br />
After all this, I can develop several projects in my GitHub and create a portfolio. I get my first training in development. I continue to long for new jobs and leaving my country remains my goal.
