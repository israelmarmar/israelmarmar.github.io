Working in an IT job in a foreign country has always been my ambition. I was a computer engineer student and already know how to program. I searched for any jobs in my field through Linkedin. But the jobs I found required knowledge in certain web patterns and languages. To meet the requirements, I searched online platforms to learn programming languages and web frameworks.
